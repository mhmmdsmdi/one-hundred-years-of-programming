# Resume Tips

**IMPORTANT POINT: NO SPELLING MISTAKES**

- Keep it to 1 page.

## Sections

- **Personal Information**
  - Email
  - LinkedIn
  - Phone number in the correct format
  - Location
  - GitHub – Only if you have active/meaningful projects
  - Portfolio website – Only if it is high quality!

- **Summary**
  - Update this section for each application, highlighting specific skills and the notable companies where you have worked.
  - One or two sentences that get straight to the point.
  - This section serves as key bullet points for ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems).
  - Include technologies that are relevant to the job application.
  - Mention any outstanding achievements (e.g., graduated from Harvard, worked at Google).
  - *Example:* `Over 5 years of experience in developing projects in the .NET tech stack. Mostly worked in the IoT domain.`
  - *Example:* `Software Engineer with X years of full-stack web development experience specializing in Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. Domain expert in e-commerce and payments as a result of working at multiple e-commerce companies.`
  - *Example:* `Senior Software Engineer @ Google with 5 years of experience leading teams.`

- **Experience**
  - List your most recent experience at the top with a detailed explanation. For older roles, provide a 2-line summary of your experience and projects.
  - Date format should be MMM YYYY (e.g., Nov 2026).
  - **MMM Cheat Sheet:**
    ```
    January   → Jan
    February  → Feb
    March     → Mar
    April     → Apr
    May       → May
    June      → Jun
    July      → Jul
    August    → Aug
    September → Sep
    October   → Oct
    November  → Nov
    December  → Dec
    ```
  - Specify if the role was **Remote, Hybrid, or On-site**.
  - Add at least 2 to 3 bullet points per job. Use the pattern: `I did X using Y`.
  - If the project has a live link and is **up to date**, include it.

- **Skills**
  - Focus on the skills you use most often or those specifically required for the job.
  - List at least 10 skills.
  - Do not add soft skills. Do not list anything you do not actually know.
  - Companies prefer specialists over generalists. Mention the specific skills the job requires. The more general your profile, the less you stand out for specialized roles.

- **Education**
  - Only add unique achievements, such as extracurricular activities, Hackathons, or specialized certifications.
  - Don't list common assignments everyone at your school has done (e.g., if every student built a weather app, don't list it). You want to appear different and more "passionate" than the competition.

## Understand What Recruiters and Engineers Look For

The more empathy you have for the person on the other side of the process, the more successful you will be. Your resume is usually reviewed by either a recruiter (who decides whether to forward you to an engineer) or a hiring engineer.

#### Recruiters 
Recruiters typically look for:
- **Job Description Fit:** Do your skills, role, and seniority match?
- **Technicalities:** Location, years of professional experience, work style (hybrid/remote), and visa status.
- **Differentiators:** Experience at a top company, graduation from a well-known school, or contributions to major/notable projects.

#### Engineers 
Engineers typically look for:
- **Specialist vs. Generalist:** Do you list every technology under the sun, or do you know your craft deeply? 
- **Tech Stack Alignment:** Have you used their specific technologies on a daily basis, or just for a small Proof of Concept (PoC)?
- **Project Relevance:** Is what you’ve built similar to what they are currently building?
- **Proactivity:** Are you a passionate coder? Engineers who experiment with new technologies in their personal time are often seen as more adaptable and skilled.
- **Tenure and Reputation:** How long have you been working, and have you worked anywhere notable?

## ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)

ATS systems are used by almost every large company to filter resumes.
- **Formatting:** Avoid fancy or complex templates. Keep it standard.
- **Fonts:** Stick to professional fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Garamond.
- **Font Size:** 10pt for general text is a good balance between readability and fitting enough content. Headers should be larger.
- **Keyword Optimization:** Use your professional summary to mention specific technologies requested in the job description. Modify this for every job.
- **Parser Friendly:** Ensure the layout is simple so a PDF parser can read it easily.
- **Specialization:** Avoid appearing spread too thin across too many different technologies. Most companies look for specialists.
