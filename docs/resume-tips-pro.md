## 🏗️ Core Sections

### 1. Personal Information
*   **Email:** Use a professional address (e.g., `firstname.lastname@gmail.com`).
*   **LinkedIn:** Ensure your profile is up to date and matches your resume.
*   **Phone Number:** Use the correct international format (e.g., `+1 (555) 000-0000`).
*   **Location:** City and State/Country (Specific address is not required).
*   **GitHub:** Include only if you have an active presence, meaningful contributions, or high-quality repositories.
*   **Portfolio Website:** Include only if the design is professional and the content showcases your best work.

### 2. Professional Summary
*Think of this as your "Elevator Pitch" and the primary target for ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems).*

*   **Customization:** Update this for every application to highlight skills relevant to the specific job description.
*   **Conciseness:** Limit this to one or two punchy sentences.
*   **Impact:** Mention notable achievements (e.g., "Graduated from Stanford," "Former Senior Dev at Google").
*   **Keywords:** Include the core technologies required for the role.

> **Examples:**
> * "Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience in the .NET tech stack, specializing in high-scale IoT domains."
> * "Senior Full-Stack Developer with expertise in Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL, with a proven track record in the e-commerce and payments industry."

### 3. Professional Experience
*   **Chronology:** List your most recent role at the top. Provide the most detail for your current/latest position.
*   **Formatting:** For older roles, limit the description to two concise lines focusing on major outcomes.
*   **Date Format:** Use `MMM YYYY` (e.g., `Nov 2024`). 
*   **Work Mode:** Explicitly state if the role was **Remote, Hybrid, or On-site**.
*   **The Formula:** Use the **"Action + Task + Tool"** pattern. 
    *   *Example:* "Architected a real-time data pipeline using Apache Kafka and Go, reducing latency by 40%."
*   **Links:** If you worked on a public-facing project, include a live link only if it is currently functional and maintained.

### 4. Skills
*   **Focus:** List at least 10 technical skills, prioritizing those mentioned in the job description.
*   **No Soft Skills:** Avoid "Team Player" or "Time Management." Let your experience bullet points prove these qualities instead.
*   **Honesty:** Never list a technology you cannot discuss in depth during a technical interview.
*   **Specialization:** Avoid looking like a "Jack of all trades." Aim to be seen as a specialist in a specific stack or domain.

### 5. Education & Extra-Curriculars
*   **Beyond the Degree:** Only list unique achievements such as Hackathons, open-source contributions, or specialized certifications.
*   **Be Different:** Avoid listing standard coursework that every student completes (e.g., a basic weather app). Highlight projects that demonstrate genuine passion and self-driven curiosity.

## 🧠 Understanding the Audience

To succeed, you must empathize with the two types of people reading your resume:

### 👤 The Recruiter
*They spend 6 seconds per resume. They look for:*
*   **Role Fit:** Does your seniority and job title match their opening?
*   **Technicalities:** Are you in the right timezone? Do you have the necessary visa status?
*   **The "Spark":** Do you have experience at a prestigious company or a top-tier university?

### 💻 The Engineer
*They look for technical depth and cultural fit:*

*   **Specialist vs. Generalist:** Do you know your tools deeply, or are you just "dabbling" in everything?
*   **Recency:** Are you using modern frameworks, or is your tech stack outdated?
*   **Proactivity:** Do you code because you love it, or just for the paycheck? Proactive coders who experiment with side projects are almost always preferred.

## 🤖 ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Optimization

*   **Keep it Simple:** Avoid multi-column layouts, images, or complex graphics. PDF parsers struggle with "fancy" templates.
*   **Typography:** Use standard, clean fonts like **Arial, Calibri, or Garamond**.
*   **Text Size:** Use **10pt** for body text to maximize content without sacrificing readability.
*   **Keyword Stuffing:** Naturally integrate keywords from the job description into your Summary and Experience sections. 
*   **AI Tools:** Use AI to help tailor your resume to specific job descriptions, but always do a final manual review.
